House Price Dataset

Skill Craft Technology

ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal of this task is to implement a Linear Regression model that predicts the prices of houses based on the following features:

Square footage of the house

Number of bedrooms

Number of bathrooms


ðŸ“‚ Dataset

We will use the House Price Dataset provided in the task.
(Link/Path to dataset if available)


ðŸ›  Steps to Complete

1.Import libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn).

2.Load and explore the dataset (check missing values, data types, summary stats).

3.Preprocess the dataset (handle nulls, convert categorical data if needed, normalize/scale features).

4.Split the data into training and testing sets.

5.Train the Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.

6.Evaluate the model using metrics such as:

â€¢Mean Squared Error (MSE)
â€¢Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
â€¢RÂ² Score

7.Visualize results (actual vs predicted prices
